## Background Information:

I use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about the most jobs posting by companies. The data contains hundreds of thousands of jobs posted in linkedin.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition


To answer these questions bellow we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 11 high level business questions related to our data:
- What are the most frequent job positions in this list?<br>
